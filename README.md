Food Application

PROBLEMS COUNTERED

1.Time Wastage whilst standing in never ending queues.

2.Hotchpotch while ordering food items.

3.Unnecessary Wastage of paper during bill generation.

The aforementioned problems can really put off the mood of any consumer at any dining place irrespective of the quality of their food.     


A SIMPLISTIC APPROACH 

1.We have created an application which is based on image detection and uses the Google “Vision” API.

2.The Application Scans the QRCode and displays a menu from which the consumer can select a food item to order.

3.Then the user will be asked to enter Food item related details and a bill will be generated.
